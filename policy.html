<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
This Privacy Policy governs your use of Mobile Application(s) (the "App"), the https://github.com/rai220 website (the "Site") and a Bot messenger operated by Konstantin Krestinkov. Because we value the privacy of our users - and because you are consenting to how we collect, use, and share information gathered through our Site, the App and the Bot messenger - we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy thoroughly. If for any reason you don’t agree with something that’s set forth below, please don’t proceed to use the Site, the App or the Bot messenger.
    <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account/App settings, we may collect personal information such as your name, email address, location, group and device names, device location names (e.g. name of the rooms), location of your devices, type of your devices, configuration details, and any other information that you provide to us when you register to use the App, configure the App, sign up for notifications or updates on the Site, or participate in our Bot messenger surveys.<br>
If you have provided us with a means of contacting you, we may use such means to communicate with you. For example, we may send you updates about our services, informational updates, surveys or promotional offers (either on our own behalf, or on behalf of other businesses), or communicate with you about your use of the Site, the App or the Bot messenger. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open a message from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking 'unsubscribe from this list' or 'update subscription preferences' at the bottom of the email you received.<br>
<h2>Information Collected Automatically</h2>
Whenever you interact with our Site, the App or the Bot messenger we automatically receive and record information on our servers, logs and databases from your browser, application, or devices. In particular, our App is designed to allow you to connect various physical devices (e.g., the Philips Hue Hub, and other devices) to the App. While connected to the App, these devices automatically report information to our servers (including information that you may have provided when setting up or configuring that device), which may include personal information, status of your devices, and other technical information. For example, if you connect a light bulb to the App, the information from that bulb will be transmitted to the App, along with any identifying information that you have chosen to associate with that device (e.g., the device name, group name, and location name that you have assigned to the bulb within the App). The type of information that is collected from each device will vary depending on the device type.<br>
Other information collected automatically through the foregoing means may include your IP address, location details, "cookie" information, mobile device, operating system, the type of browser, demographic information, application and/or device(s) you're using to access our Site, the App and the Bot messenger click-through paths, the identity of the page or feature you are requesting or interacting with, time on page of feature, and other indicators of how you are interacting with the Site, the App and the Bot messenger. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your device that allow us to recognize your browser, application or device and tell us how and when various pages and features in our Site are visited or used and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser, application or device to prevent or limit your device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. In addition, our third party partners, including advertising partners, may also use web beacons, or transmit cookies to and read cookies from your browser, application or device when you visit or use our Site. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties. Also, please note that our systems do not currently recognize or respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals.<br>
<h2>Storage of Information</h2>
We retain the information we collect from you so that we can improve our Site and App and provide a better experience to our users. By using our Site, the App and the Bot messenger, you expressly consent to the storage of the information we collect from you.<br>
<h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
We may share your information with our vendors, suppliers, advertisers, analytics companies, and others to improve our Site, the App or the Bot messenger and the relevance of the content provided by those third parties. This information is shared in aggregate form. We may share your registration information - your name, email, or other personally identifiable information - with third parties to help us communicate with you. We utilize third-party analytics, including Google Analytics, to understand our users better so that we can improve our Site, the App and the Bot messenger to you.<br>
We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br>
We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, personal information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.<br>
<h2>Third-Party Sites and Features</h2>
Our Site may contain links to other websites operated by third parties and may include social media features such as Facebook and Twitter buttons (such as "Like," "Tweet" or "Pin"). These third-party sites may collect information about you if you click on a link and the social media sites may automatically record information about your browsing behavior every time you visit a site that has a social media button. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature, not by our privacy policy. We do not control what information these third parties collect. Please review your privacy settings on your social media sites and think carefully before clicking on links which may take you to a third-party website.<br>
<h2>The Site and App are NOT for Children 13 and Under</h2>
Unfortunately, our Site, App and the Bot messenger are not for children under age 13. By using the Site or App, you represent that you are 13 years of age or older. If you are under 13, do not use the Site, the App and the Bot messenger or send any information about yourself to us. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at k.krestnikov@gmail. We will delete personally identifiable information from a user within a reasonable period of time after learning that the user was under 13.<br>
<h2>Your Consent to International Data Transfer</h2>
The Site, the App and the Bot messenger are operated from the United States of America. If you reside outside the U.S., you consent to the transfer of your information to the U.S., as your information will be processed and stored there. By using my Site, the App or the Bot messenger, regardless of your location, you consent to our collection, storage, use, and sharing of your information, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time), and in particular to improve my Site, the App or the Bot messenger. Should you choose at any time to withdraw your consent, you may not continue to use the Site, the App or the Bot messenger. Please note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information to the United States, which may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.<br>
    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, without prior notice. When we do, we will post the changed policy on our Site, and we will revise the Effective Date listed below. If the changes are material (as determined in our discretion), we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change, such as through sending an email to any address you may have provided to us, through a pop-up window on the Site or in the App, or other similar mechanism through the Bot messenger as appropriate under the circumstances. By continuing to use the Site, the App or the Bot messenger after we post the revised Privacy Policy to them, you signify your acceptance of the revised policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy so you know how we are collecting, using, and sharing your information.
